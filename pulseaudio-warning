This is what happens when you build with:

    --disable-pulseaudio

==-- WARNING --==

_____________________________________________________________________
The only audio output method supported by Ecore right now is via
Pulseaudio. You have disabled that and likely have broken a whole
bunch of things in the process. Reconsider your configure options.

_____________________________________________________________________
Multisense has been disabled. This causes Edje audio suport to
Simply not work, and will break applications and libraries
that rely on it with users then reporting bugs.
If you want to mute audio, there are APIs and policies to do
that, as opposed to compiling it out.
